- 'def' is a built-in keyword that tells Ruby that this is the start of a method definition.
-'' my_name' is the name of your new method. You can name your methods almost anything you want,
 but there are some constraints and conventions.

- "Rifah Sajida" is the code inside the method body. All of the logic for your method is contained in the indented lines
 of the method body. This particular method returns a string when the method is called.

- 'end' is a built-in keyword that tells Ruby that this is the end of the method definition.
To call the method, you need to use its name, as shown in the last line of the example.
