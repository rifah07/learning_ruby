You'll often write the same code in different parts of your program.
Wouldn't it be nice if you could use the same code many times without
writing it again and again? That's what methods do! Methods let you give a name
to a piece of code. Then you can use that code anywhere in your program just by calling its name.
This idea is called DRY programming: Don't Repeat Yourself.
When you reuse code instead of copying it everywhere, your program becomes easier to read and work with.

According to The Ruby Programming Language book:
Many languages distinguish between functions,
which have no associated object, and
methods, which are invoked on a receiver object.
Because Ruby is a purely object-oriented language,
all methods are true methods and are associated with at least one object.

=begin
Basically, because everything in Ruby is an object,
Ruby only has methods, not functions. With that established,
we know that when we’re talking about Ruby, “methods” and “functions” refer to the same thing.
