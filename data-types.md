# Ruby Basic Data Types

Ruby is very object-oriented, which means that absolutely everything in Ruby is an object, even the most basic data types. There are mainly six types of data commonly used in Rubyâ€™s basic data types:

- Numbers (integers and floats)
- Strings
- Symbols
- Booleans (`true`, `false`, and `nil`)
- Arrays
- Hashes

## Ruby Data Types Table

| Data Type | Example         | Description                                 |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Number    | `42`, `3.14`   | Integers and floats for numeric values      |
| String    | `"hello"`      | Sequence of characters                      |
| Symbol    | `:name`        | Immutable, reusable identifier              |
| Boolean   | `true`, `false`| Logical true/false values                   |
| Array     | `[1, 2, 3]`    | Ordered, index-based collection             |
| Hash      | `{a: 1, b: 2}` | Key-value pairs (dictionary-like structure) |

## Numbers

Ruby supports all the typical math operators you would expect.
