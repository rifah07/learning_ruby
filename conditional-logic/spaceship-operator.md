# Ruby Spaceship Operator (`<=>`)

The **spaceship operator** (`<=>`) is a special comparison operator in Ruby that compares two values and tells you which one is bigger, smaller, or if they're equal.

## Why is it called "Spaceship"? 

It's called the spaceship operator because `<=>` looks like a little spaceship or TIE fighter from Star Wars! ðŸš€

## What does it do?

The spaceship operator compares two things and returns:
- **`-1`** if the left side is **smaller**
- **`0`** if both sides are **equal**  
- **`1`** if the left side is **bigger**

## Easy way to remember:

Think of the symbols from left to right:
- `<` (less than) = `-1` 
- `=` (equal) = `0`
- `>` (greater than) = `1`
